## Introduction

<a href="https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/server_manual/index.html">QGIS Server</a>
is a map server - based on the QGIS core library and rendering engine - which
provides numerous classical services like WMS, WFS, WCS, WMTS and lastly OGC
API Features (implemented by the <a href="https://www.qcooperative.net/">QCooperative</a>)
since QGIS 3.10.  Furthermore, the certification process has been reached for
WMS 1.3.0 since QGIS 3.0 and has also been renewed for the LTR version 3.10.

However, there are several kind of extensions for the WMS protocol, especially
for dimensions. This way, some specific optional parameters may be supported
like `ELEVATION`{:.inline} or `TIME`{:.inline}. Today, we're going to take a
closer look to the last point: the WMS-T protocol.

QGIS Server 3.10 is shipped with a basic dimension support (implemented by
<a href="https://www.3liz.com/">3Liz</a>)
allowing to use the WMS-T protocol for vector layers. Unfortunately, raster
layers are left behind... but nothing is impossible with Python plugins :).

In this article, we're going to take a look on the WMS-T configuration in case
of vector layers. And last but not least, we'll see how to write a basic Python
plugin to support the `TIME`{:.inline} parameter for raster layers in case of
simple use cases.
