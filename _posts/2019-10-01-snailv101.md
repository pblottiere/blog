## Introduction

Using QGIS provides (of course) an unrivalled pleasure, but like all leafy
softwares, you may encounter performance issues. Indeed, QGIS Desktop supports
a wide variety of
<a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/supported_data.html">vector and raster formats</a>
and rendering options are absolutely brilliant.
However, the counterparty in terms of performance may be very severe in some
situation.  The most classic example is the advanced
<a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#draw-effects">draw effects</a>
properties providing very fancy effects, but which is also a dead weight for
performances.

<br/>

In essence, when a user hits performance issues, detecting the underlying cause
may be very difficult due to the large number of possible causes:

- data provider: PostGIS, Spatialite, geopackage, spatial index, ...
- labelling options: positions, size, number of candidates, ...
- network connection: WMS, WFS, NFS, ...
- symbology and expressions resolution
- and so much more

Over and above this short list of examples, the number and the size of your data
is also critical. For example, if your project loads numerous layers or if you are
working on heavy raster images, the rendering time and your CPU/RAM will
probably be very busy and the rendering (meaning the navigation) won't be so
responsive.

This way, the idea behind <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/snail/">Snail</a>
is to provide a plugin allowing any enduser to analyse its runtime QGIS Desktop
performances. To be honest, Snail is doing very little for now, but let's say
that I'm optimist for the future :). In the meantime, let's take a look on our
first use case: monitoring the CPU and RAM consumption of the QGIS process.
