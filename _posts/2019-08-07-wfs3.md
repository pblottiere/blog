## Introduction

There are various map servers available in the Open Source world, each with
advantages and disadvantages. <a href="https://mapserver.org/">Map Server</a>
and <a href="http://geoserver.org/">GeoServer</a> are the most famous, but QGIS
provides a map server too, named <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/index.html">QGIS Server</a>.
The main advantage of QGIS Server is the possibility to configure the project
to serve through QGIS Desktop, meaning that the rendering is completely
identical.

QGIS Server provides some classical OGC services like WMS, WFS, WCS or even
WMTS since QGIS 3.4. Certification process is ongoing for WFS 1.1.0 and has
been reached for WMS 1.3.0 since QGIS 3.0. It also has been renewed for the LTR
version 3.4.

And now, thanks to the work of
<a href="https://github.com/elpaso">Alessandro Pasotti</a>, QGIS Server is
going to provide a completely new OGC service: WFS 3! Let's take a look to the
possibilities given by this brand-new protocol.
