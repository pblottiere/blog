# [2016 - 2019] Oslandia

2016 was the year I decided to fully immerse myself in Open Source community
dedicated to Geographical Information System. For this purpose, I joined
<a href="https://oslandia.com/en/">Oslandia</a>, a company specialized in GIS
architecture with Open Source softwares.  I notably became a QGIS core comitter
and has been elected French QGIS Voting Member in 2018.

# [2013 - 2016] Actimar

In 2013, I joined an Earth Observation service specialised in high frequency
surface radar and hyperspectral imaging. This way, I was given the opportunity
to further develop my skills towards embedded systems and cartographic
applications with Open Source libraries. In particular, it was my first step in
GDAL and QGIS world.

# [2011 - 2013] Thales Airborne System

For 2 years in a middlware service, I developped drivers for avionics military
devices and elaborated Embedded Operating System from scratch. Acquiring
environmental data and sending these on a cartographic application were my
first steps in remote sensing and Geographical Information System in general.
