# Embedded Systems

Thanks to my professional experience, I have been giving some teachings in
Embedded Systems at <a href="https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/en"> _ENSTA_ </a>
(french engineering school) for 5 years now.

Supports (lectures and laboratories) are available on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/pblottiere/embsys"> _embsys_ </a>.
