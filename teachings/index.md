# Embedded Systems

Thanks to my professional experience, I have been giving some teachings in
Embedded Systems at <a href="https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/en"> _ENSTA_ </a>
for 5 years now.

Lectures and laboratories are available on GitHub:

# Distributed Systems

I have been giving a hand in Distributed Systems laboratories (MPI, RPC,
RabbitMQ, ...) at <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en">_IMT Atlantique_</a>
for 5 years.

# Formations

For several years now, I have been giving training courses in software
engineering, especially on QGIS (usage, Python plugins, C++).
