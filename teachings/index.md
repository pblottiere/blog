# QGIS Training

For several years now, I am a professional instructor specialised on QGIS
software.  User training, Python plugin or C++ core development are always a
good way to fuel thinking and creativity.

# Embedded Systems

Thanks to my professional experience in avionics middleware development,
I have been teaching GNU/Linux Embedded Systems to final year
students at <a href="https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/en">ENSTA</a>
for 5 years now. System Programming, U-Boot and Yocto are extensively studied
and concepts are applied on ARM single board computer. The final exam
consists in designing and building an IP camera installed on servo-motors.

Lectures and laboratories are available on GitHub:

# Distributed Systems

Through my professional projects, I am used to work and design distributed
architectures. Therefore, I'm regularly called to give a hand in Distributed Systems
laboratories (MPI, RPC, RabbitMQ, ...) to final year students at
<a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en">IMT Atlantique</a>.

It's always a pleasure to come back to my former engineering school!
